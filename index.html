      Human rights are an important part of our society, and the right to health is no different. <br> <br>

      Medicinal drug shortages are a huge problem around the world for all kinds of people. <br>
      Some people even need it to live, and recently there was a huge shortage of insulin in the US. <br>
      Around 1 in 9 people living in the US have some form of diabetes, and rely on insulin everyday to regulate their blood glucose levels. <br> <br> <br>
      

      So, how are people dealing with it? Why is there a shortage in the first place? <br>
      How is it challenging peoples' rights?
    </p>

  <div id = "part1">
    <h2>Sub-Question #1</h2>
    <h3 id = "subtext">Who is being affected by the shortage and how are they dealing with it?</h3>
  </div>

  <div id = "part1text">
    <p>
      <!--I ACTUALLY FEEL SO GOOD RIGHT NOW MY 2 BRAIN CELLS WORKED TOGETHER AND REMEMBERED THE WORD DEMOGRAPHIC WHY AM I SO PROUD OF MYSELF-->

      Obviously the shortage affected US citizens, but what demographics were affected by it? Were some affected more than others? <br>
      What did these people do about it? <br> <br>

      There are around 341.8 million people living in the US, and about 38.4 million of them are diabetics. <br>
      That's almost 3 times as many people as the population of Tokyo, which is the most populated city in the world. <br>
      It also seems West Virginia has the most diabetic people in the US, while South Dakota and Colorado have the least. <br> <br>

      A lot of diabetics had to call around nearby pharmacies to try and find some insulin, but most of the time with no success. <br>
      This, of course, caused a lot of stress and anxiety for people, especially those that had almost run out of insulin. <br>
      Some people had tried to ration what little insulin they had left, but even that was only a temporary solution. <br>
      Professionals advised people to try and get their insulin week earlier, and if they couldn't get it then they should "seek emergency care". <br>
      As you can expect, some people tried any alternatives they could find, such as switching to prefilled injectable pens, or using different types of insulin <br>
      A lot of the time however, this doesn't really work very well. Everyone has different reactions to different types of insulin, so you can't really use other types.

    <h2>Sub-Question #2</h2>
    <h3 id = "subtext">What caused the shortage and what insulin was being affected?</h3>
  </div>

  <div id = "part2text">

      <!--i still need to organise this stuff i just kinda dumped it here-->

      Different types of insulin are produced differently, so what kinds are being affected? How many people use each one? <br>
      What's actually causing the shortage? <br> <br>

      Eli Lilly is the manufacturer of the most common type of insulin used, known as Humalog. <br>
      Humalog is the main type of insulin being affected by the shortage, with prices being reported as high as $274.70 for a single 10ml. <br>
      On top of that, Danish insulin manufacturer Novo Nordisk have started phasing out another well-known type of insulin, Levemir. <br>
      They plan to have it gone completely by the end of 2024, mainly due to "global manufacturing issues" and "decreasing insurance coverage". <br> <br>

      Medicinal drug shortages can be caused by a variety of things, including unpredictable demand and manufacturing problems, as is the case with Humalog. <br>
      Humalog is apparently having shortages due to a "brief delay in manufacturing", causing pharmacies to be out of stock. <br>
      As previously mentioned, this is rising insulin prices drastically, and Eli Lilly has been putting in systems to cap it at $35, making it more afforable for everyone. <br> <br>

      Insulin supplies are normally decently predictable, so when something like this happens suddenly it gets a little concerning. <br>
      Another thing to note is that typically, sterile injectables are at higher risk of shortage than other drugs, which does include insulin.

  <div id = "part3">
    <h2>Sub-Question #3</h2>
    <h3 id = "subtext">How are people's rights being affected by the shortage?</h3>
  </div>

  <div id = "part3text">
    <p>
      The right to food and health is an important one, and considering the fact that insulin is a medicine that many people rely on to live, how is the shortage affecting it? <br> <br>

      Article 25 of the Universal Decleration of Human Rights states that everyone has a right to food and health. <br>
      Considering the fact that diabetics need insulin to both eat food <i>and</i> maintain their blood glucose levels, it appears to go against this right. <br>
      When someones blood glucose gets too high it can have serious health implications, sometimes if it goes too high it can even be fatal. <br>
      Shortages of medicine everywhere, not just insulin, have been affecting people for a long time, as well as their rights. <br>
      Why should some people have to suffer, to have their rights affected, from something they can't even control?

  <div id = "conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  </div>

  <div id = "conclusiontext">
    <p>
      So, in conclusion, a recent shortage of insulin in the US has caused many diabetics to become anxious about running out of their medicine they rely on to live. <br>
      Many people have been doing whatever they can to get it, but it has proven difficult due to supplies running low and prices rising drastically. <br>
      Eli Lilly - the manufacturer of the most popular type of insulin, Humalog - have announced that they have a "brief delay in manufacturing", which is one of the main reasons why there is a shortage. <br>
      When diabetics can't get their insulin it can have serious health side effects, which is affecting their right to health and food (Article 25). <br> <br>

      So, that's pretty much all I could find. Thanks for reading and (hopefully) not falling asleep!
